# Project_Bloodbath
Blood Bank Full Stack Project
Blood Bank is a web application designed to add new donors to a bloodbank's database, and then a signed-in administrator can add units of donation to a specific donor. 


#Intro
The Bloodbath web app was created as part of a group full-stack project for the full time web development April 2022 cohort at Digital Crafts. The goal of the project is to practice interacting with PostgreSQL databases, and utilizing our own server/ hosting on Heroku.
