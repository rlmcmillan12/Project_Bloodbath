# Project Bloodbath
~ THIS IS NOT A REAL MEDICAL APP, IT WAS ONLY CREATED FOR A FULL STACK GROUP PROJECT.~ 

---

# Intro
The Bloodbath web app was created as part of a group full-stack project for the full time web development April 2022 cohort at Digital Crafts. The goal of the project is to practice interacting with PostgreSQL databases, utilizing our own server/ hosting on Heroku.

# General Information

#### This project was created to solidify our knowledge of core concepts we had recently learned with PostgreSQL specifically using Sequelize. In addition to using our own server for this project, we also incorporated user authentication to simulate a real life medical facility. Where a admin would have to be logged-in in order to have access to the donor's personal information. All of the web app's features are disabled until an admin is logged-in. And only a logged-in admin has the ability to register a new user/admin. Once logged in the admin is redirected to their dashboard which displays the most recent donations that have been received from a donor. The admin has the ability to add a donor, or look up a donor that is already in the database by selecting the donor tab and inputting the donor's DOB. Once this search is completed the admin then has the ability to add the specific number of donations that were received from that donor.
